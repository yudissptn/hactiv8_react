            Hello, JavaScript &amp; Node.js <br />
            Get ready for our monthly meetup JakartaJS! This will be our fifth
            meetup of 2018! <br />
            The meetup format will contain some short stories and technical
            talks. <br />
            If you have a short announcement you'd like to share with the
            audience, you may do so during open mic announcement. <br /> <br />
            Remember to bring photo ID to get through building security. <br />
            <br />
            ----- <br /> <br /> See you there!! <br /> <br /> Best, Hengki,
            Giovanni, Sofian, Riza, Agung The JakartaJS Organizers
